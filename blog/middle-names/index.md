Since they didn't know, I looked at students at a university. Cornell University
email addresses can contain two or three letters, depending on whether the Cornellian
has a middle name. I pulled all of the email addresses of then-current Cornell University
students from Cornell University's public LDAP service and came up with this plot.

![A plot of middle name prevalence by school among Cornell University shows
that 15824 students had middle names and 6649 not and that the proportion varies
substantially by school, the graduate school having a particularly low
rate of middle names and the agriculture school having a particularly high rate.
