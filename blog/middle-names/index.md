Since they didn't know, I looked at students at a university. Cornell University
email addresses can contain two or three letters, depending on whether the Cornellian
has a middle name. I [retrieved](https://gitorious.org/tlevine/toilet_survey/blobs/master/sample/ced.sh)
all of the email addresses of then-current Cornell University students from the
[Cornell Electronic Directory](http://www.it.cornell.edu/services/thunderbird/howto/troubleshooting_detail.cfm?id=143944)
and came up with this plot.

![A plot of middle name prevalence by school among Cornell University shows
that 15824 students had middle names and 6649 not and that the proportion varies
substantially by school, the graduate school having a particularly low
rate of middle names and the agriculture school having a particularly high rate.

I suspected that students underreport rather than overreport middle names,
probably by accident. Over the past couple weeks, I
[looked at](https://github.com/tlevine/united-states-middlenames)
the names of 85,822,194 dead americans and came up with some more plots
