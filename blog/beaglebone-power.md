BeagleBone Power Supply
=======
Draft

I want to make a cluster of [BeagleBones](http://beagleboard.org/bone),
so I'm pondering how to power them. I could just use a bunch of
[standard, recommended power supplies](http://beagleboard.org/peripheral#5V),
like [Matt at Liquidware did](http://antipastohw.blogspot.com/2010/09/how-to-make-beagleboard-elastic-r.html),
but that seems messy and expensive.

I could just [use a standard PC power supply](http://www.instructables.com/id/Power-Supply-For-Arduino-power-and-breadboard/),
but that would be heavy and quite inefficient.

Powering the BeagleBones over [USB might not work](http://beagleboard.org/support/faq),


and if it does, it would substantially increase power consumption.
